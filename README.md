# Kickstarter-Challenge
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns their success, and failure. How much money each gathered and when.  The Analysis is to assist a client, Louise, in determining the best course of action for her own Kickstarter campaign. 
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:

A client, Louise, requested an analysis of Entertainment oriented Kickstarter data with the goal of determining how best to format her own Entertainment based Kickstarter campaign.

### Purpose

To analyze a large block of data and organize it into a format easily digestible, understandable, by the client.  Addressing specific issues and filtering out irrelevant data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Since this data is centered around the category of theater productions all references will be theater.  A cursory glance shows us that there are three periods of success and failure that peak roughly in common. February May, and October all other months are part of the transition from lower to higher, or higher to lower rates of success and failure.  Only canceled productions remains steady with slight variations in June, July, and august. The total break in canceled productions from September to November could be considered and outlier.  As we can see from the chart the greatest number of successful productions is in May with a long slide down into September and a minor peak in October.  While failed productions has a minor peak in May the greatest number of failed productions is in October.  As may has the highest success rate it is logical to assume that any production started in May will succeed. While it is highly likely that any production started in October will fail.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Charting the results based on the Goal of the project has produced results that are almost the antithesis of the outcomes based on launch date.  Where the results of the previous graph ran almost parallel to each other, it is clear that project success, and failure based on goals is much more volatile.  Examination of the data and the resultant chart shows starting at less than $1000 dollars and continuing to the $15,000 to $19,000 dollar range success drops off at a steady rate while failure rises at the exact same rate. This trend can be seen throughout the chart, and it can be assumed that if goal level were allowed to increase beyond $50,000 that we would again see another confluence where failure overtakes success.  Applying a touch of psychology, we can infer there are three classes of patrons.  As a goal becomes larger first class of patrons become less and less likely to donate. After the $19,000 dollar mark where success and failure meet the drop off in donations continues until the $29,999 dollar mark where the second class of patrons picks up the load and there is a steady increase in the number of successful productions.  Again, there is a limit to how far patrons will dip into their wallets.  At the $44,999 dollar mark we see a sharp decline until there are no donations at the $45,000 dollar mark.  The third, final, and wealthiest class of patron then takes over and successful productions begin once again to pick up.
There is no need to infer a fourth or even fifth class of patron since anyone with a larger enough budget to allow for $50,000 dollar donations to the arts is clearly capable of making much larger donation.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Sorting the useless and irrelevant data and determining what the client needed to make good decisions while not allowing the amount of
data to be overwhelming.  Excel formulas not working as they should, and then suddenly working exactly as they should.  Incomplete comprehension 
of what exactly was required.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Production should start in April with the goal of finishing by late May or the beginning of June at the latest.
September through December should be avoided and the same with January.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Since the client has not included how much her production will cost it is hard to advise her based on goals. If the Clients projected production cost is anywhere between $10,000 and $34,999, she should be encouraged to set the goal to at least $37,000 or $38,000 and budget for potential cost overruns. Or baring that, bonuses to the performers.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Not enough data on the specific items that the client is interested in. The data set covers a broad base of entertainment categories and while it would balloon
the initial data set to enormous proportions irrelevant categories could be filtered out. It would require extra work, but a larger data set more focused on the clients
specific areas of interest might provide greater insight for the client and her needs.

- What are some other tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Currency conversion: convert all foreign currency amounts into US dollar amounts based on todayâ€™s exchange rate then graph how much all successful theater and play productions cost.
